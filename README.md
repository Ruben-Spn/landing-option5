This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It uses typescript and tailwindcss. Animations are done with the help of GSAP and css. I animated the illustration using lottie and implemented it using its react component.

Production is hosted here: [https://landing-option5-f8k7.vercel.app/](https://landing-option5-f8k7.vercel.app/)
